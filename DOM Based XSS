URI fragment in the url like www.bread.com/#1 . # means page for user when press back button will return to previous page.

But the hacker can put the code in the url after #

$(document).onload(function() {
  var page = window.location.hash;
  loadPage(page);

  $("#page-no").html(page);
});

window.location.hash value is written into the DOM as raw HTML - a major security hole.
